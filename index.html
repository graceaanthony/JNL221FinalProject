      <p>    The gender pay gap persists across <a href= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/gender-pay-gap-statistics">most industries</a>, including <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/sports-global-market-report&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1715280298427343&usg=AOvVaw0h_ay-APtUYOccyc3a9F0G">the multi-billion-dollar </a> sports industry. At the collegiate level, coaches of women’s teams, regardless of gender, have historically made less money partly due to the lack of revenue that women’s teams generate. 
</p>
      <p>   According to Associate Dean at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, Brad Horn, “recognizing that bias has existed for generations in the perceptions of fan interest and revenue between men’s and women’s basketball in college athletics, pay disparity by gender is a long-standing issue in fairness and equity.”  
</p>
      <p>   Women’s sports teams are more often than not given less funding from universities.  “The gender gap in funding approached nearly 3-to-1 ratios when examining expenditures for recruiting, as well as compensation for head coaches and assistant coaches,” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1107242271/the-ncaa-says-that-funding-for-women-in-college-sports-is-falling-behind">
        a 2022 NPR investigation found.  </a>  
</p>
 
<p>  
    <p>    Comparing data of public university salaries for women’s and men’s Power Five conference basketball coaches or a team that has made it to at least three of the last five NCAA Tournaments is revealing. 18 out of 62 women’s basketball coaches in these categories make at least $1 million. Alternatively, 56 out of 63 men’s team coaches make at least $1 million.

      <p>      The University of Kansas’s Bill Self made the highest 2024 salary, according to the analysis, rounding out at more than $9.4 million. His team finished the 2024 season 23-11 and lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The highest paid women’s coach, Kim Mulkey of Louisiana State University, earns $3.15 million. She led her team to finish the season 31-6 making it to the elite eight of the NCAA Tournament. 
 </p>
      <p>      These are two different programs, however the success of a team is often an indicator of how much compensation a coach will receive from a university. 
 </p>
      <p>     The UConn Huskies have long been dominant in the world of women’s basketball under coach Geno Auriemma. This season his team finished the season with a winning percentage of 84.62 and made it to the final four.  His annual salary is $3.1 million. The coach of the men’s team, Dan Hurley, earns $5 million.  His team finished the season with a winning percentage of 92.50 and a national title. There is a 7.88 difference between the winning percentages, but an almost $2 million difference in pay.

      <p>      Due to the drastic difference in average coaching salaries, women’s basketball programs are a better value per win. From the standpoint of a university, men’s basketball coaches are paid more per win than head coaches of the women’s team.

      <p>      With the increase in media coverage for women’s basketball this season, it will be interesting to see if women’s basketball will begin to generate more revenue. If there is more 
equality of revenue between the men’s and women’s teams, will coaches’ pay reflect that? 
</p>
      <p> “Ratings for the women’s sport topped the men’s game significantly in 2023-24, so I do expect that coaching salaries will reflect this evolution, but I also expect that only a few programs will be truly equitable in meeting pay equity. The temptation is simply too great for administrators to point to attendance and ratings as the drivers of revenue in men’s basketball, which is not the right approach, but a one that many will use to justify through a profit and loss analysis,” Horn said.

      <p> About the data:
<p>

        <p> The data is from USA Today’s responses to a survey of all forms of compensation for women’s and men’s basketball coaches from schools in a Power Five conference or a team that has made it to at least three of the last five NCAA Tournaments. All of the institutions are public, as private schools do not disclose information regarding compensation to the public domain. The data used in this story comes from the most recently available base salary as of March 13, 2024.
